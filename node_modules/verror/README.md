# verror: rich JavaScript errors

This module provides several classes in support of Joyent's [Best Practices for
Error Handling in Node.js](http://www.joyent.com/developers/node/design/errors).
If you find any of the behavior here confusing or surprising, check out that
document first.

The error classes here support:

* printf-style arguments for the message
* chains of causes
* properties to provide extra information about the error
* creating your own subclasses that support all of these

The classes here are:

* **VError**, for chaining errors while preserving each one's error message.
  This is useful in servers and command-line utilities when you want to
  propagate an error up a call stack, but allow various levels to add their own
  context.  See examples below.
* **WError**, for wrapping errors while hiding the lower-level messages from the
  top-level error.  This is useful for API endpoints where you don't want to
  expose internal error messages, but you still want to preserve the error chain
  for logging and debugging.
* **SError**, which is just like VError but interprets printf-style arguments
  more strictly.
* **MultiError**, which is just an Error that encapsulates one or more other
  errors.  (This is used for parallel operations that return several errors.)


# Quick start

First, install the package:

    npm install verror

If nothing else, you can use VError as a drop-in replacement for the built-in
JavaScript Error class, with the addition of printf-style messages:

```javascript
var err = new VError('missing file: "%s"', '/etc/passwd');
