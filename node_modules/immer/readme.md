Immer (German for: always) is a tiny package that allows you to work with immutable state in a more convenient way. It is based on the [_copy-on-write_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write) mechanism.

The basic idea is that you will apply all your changes to a temporarily _draftState_, which is a proxy of the _currentState_. Once all your mutations are completed, Immer will produce the _nextState_ based on the mutations to the draft state. This means that you can interact with your data by simply modifying it while keeping all the benefits of immutable data.

Using Immer is like having a personal assistant; he takes a letter (the current state) and gives you a copy (draft) to jot changes onto. Once you are done, the assistant will take your draft and produce the real immutable, final letter for you (the next state).

A mindful reader might notice that this is quite similar to `withMutations` of ImmutableJS. It is indeed, but generalized and applied to plain, native JavaScript data structures (arrays and objects) without further needing any library.

## API

The Immer package exposes a default function that does all the work.

`produce(currentState, producer: (draftState) => void): nextState`

There is also a curried overload that is explained [below](#currying).

## Example

```javascript
import produce from "immer"

const baseState = [
    {
        todo: "Learn typescript",
        done: true
    },
    {
        todo: "Try immer",
        done: false
    }
]

const nextState = produce(baseState, draftState => {
    draftState.push({todo: "Tweet about it"})
    draftState[1].done = true
})
```

The interesting thing about Immer is that the `baseState` will be untouched, but the `nextState` will reflect all changes made to `draftState`.

```javascript
// the new item is only added to the next state,
// base state is unmodified
expect(baseState.length).toBe(2)
expect(nextState.length).toBe(3)

// same for
