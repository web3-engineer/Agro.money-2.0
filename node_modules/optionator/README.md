## Why?
The  problem with other option parsers, such as `yargs` or `minimist`, is they just accept all input, valid or not.
With Optionator, if you mistype an option, it will give you an error (with a suggestion for what you meant).
If you give the wrong type of argument for an option, it will give you an error rather than supplying the wrong input to your application.

    $ cmd --halp
    Invalid option '--halp' - perhaps you meant '--help'?

    $ cmd --count str
    Invalid value for option 'count' - expected type Int, received value: str.

Other helpful features include reformatting the help text based on the size of the console, so that it fits even if the console is narrow, and accepting not just an array (eg. process.argv), but a string or object as well, making things like testing much easier.
